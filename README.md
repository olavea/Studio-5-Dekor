# Studio-5-Dekor

Practicing using Stripe And Gatsby to set up t-shirt sales

## How to run the script

1. Update the api key in each file
2. Update product id for each sku

- Use the product id from Stripe
- Use find and replace for each file (no need to manually change each one)

3. Open terminal
4. Write `npm install stripe`
5. Write `node Cat.js` (make sure there are no error messages)
6. Write `node Leopard.js` (make sure there are no error messages)
7. Write `node Tiger.js` (make sure there are no error messages)

Do not commit the changes as we do not want the api keys on GitHub.
